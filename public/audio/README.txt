Place your small, loop-safe OGG files here:

- flow-hum.ogg       # low A2 hum, seamless loop, ~15–30s, -2 dB
- wind-breath.ogg    # airy wind/breath texture, 20–30s, -6 dB

Keep each file under ~1–2 MB if possible.
Export mono OGG (or light stereo) with zero-crossing loop points.
Audio only starts after user toggles Flow Mode.
