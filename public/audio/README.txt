Place your small, loop-safe OGG files here:

- flow-hum.ogg       # low A2 hum, seamless loop, ~15–30s, -2 dB
- wind-breath.ogg    # airy wind/breath texture, 20–30s, -6 dB

Tips:
- Keep each file under ~1–2 MB if possible.
- Export mono OGG (or light stereo) and ensure zero-crossing loop points.
- We start at 0 volume and fade in after the user clicks Flow Mode.
- No words. This is an ambient layer only.
