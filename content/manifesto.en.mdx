# Manifesto — The Power of the Powerless

We are a movement of everyday people who refuse to outsource our future. Gatishil restores the flow between community, culture, and cooperative wealth.

## Our Vows

1. **Serve before self.** Power is a duty, not a prize.
2. **Guard the commons.** Land, forests, and rivers belong to the people.
3. **Publish everything.** Decisions, budgets, and attendance stay transparent.
4. **Reward contribution.** Labor and care are honoured with ownership.
5. **Practice consent.** Every household has the right to opt in or out.
6. **Defend culture.** Languages, rituals, and crafts deserve living stewards.
7. **Build solidarity.** Rural and urban, homeland and diaspora, move together.
8. **Stay accountable.** When vows break, leadership rotates.

## Call to Action

This manifesto is a living document. Read it, translate it in your heart, and bring it to your ward, your cooperative, and your family table. Gatishil only works when you do.
