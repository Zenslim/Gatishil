## Manual Review Summary

Targeted searches for common secret patterns did not identify any exposed credentials or PII in the repository. Representative queries and results:

- `rg -n "SUPABASE"` – only references to environment variables and documentation guidance. No hard-coded keys were found.
- `rg -n "sk-"` – no OpenAI-style keys detected; matches limited to dependency metadata.
- `rg -n "secret"` – occurrences limited to documentation, localized cryptography helpers, and new tooling configuration.

## Findings

No secrets or PII requiring remediation were identified during the audit. Continue to run the new CI workflows and pre-commit hooks to maintain coverage as the codebase evolves.
