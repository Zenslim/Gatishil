# Cleanup Report

- **Timestamp:** 2025-10-18T10:15:33Z (UTC)

| Removed item | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| `OVERWRITE_MANIFEST.json` | `git grep -n "OVERWRITE_MANIFEST"` returned no matches, confirming the manifest is unused. |
| `PACKAGE_JSON_NOTE.txt` | No references found via `git grep`, and content duplicated information already covered in `package.json`. |
| `PATCH-OnboardingFlow.after-AtmaDisha.txt` | Historical patch note with no references in the codebase per `git grep`. |
| `README_API_PATCH.txt` & `README_FORCE_API_ROUTES.txt` | Redundant legacy API instructions; only self-referenced mentions were detected when searching for their filenames. |
| `git-commit.bat` | Windows helper script never invoked anywhere (`git grep -n "git-commit.bat"` returned no hits). |
| `next.config.js` | Duplicate of the active `next.config.mjs`; no imports or tooling references relied on the CommonJS variant. |
| `openapi.yml` | API schema not referenced in repo or build tooling per `git grep -n "openapi.yml"`. |
| `e2e/` & `playwright.config.ts` | Playwright suite had no package scripts or CI workflows referencing it; only internal imports existed within the deleted files. |
| `prisma/` | No Prisma packages in dependencies and no `prisma` imports/CLI calls discovered via `git grep`. |
| `release-please-config.json` & `.release-please-manifest.json` | `git grep -n "release-please"` across workflows/scripts returned no usages, so release-please automation is inactive. |

`npm run build` was attempted after cleanup, but the process failed early because `npm install` cannot fetch `@simplewebauthn/browser` from the registry in this environment (HTTP 403). No missing-file errors related to the removals were encountered before that registry failure.
